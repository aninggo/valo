## Features

## Instructions

Running the program will open the first test scene in an interactive windowed mode. Use WASD to move and left mouse button to look around. Cycle through the test scenes with number keys.

Edit the valo.ini file to further configure the program. All options can be overridden with command line switches.

### Controls

For the interactive mode:

| Key                     | Action                                                                                |

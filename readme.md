You will also need the [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145).

The CUDA version runs on NVIDIA GTX 900 Series or newer and the Intel-specific version runs on Ivy Bridge processors or newer.

## Features

- Physically based renderer
  - Uses path tracing to solve the rendering equation
  - Materials with BRDFs and PDFs (only Lambertian at the moment)
  - (Multiple) importance sampling
  - Russian roulette
  - Direct light sampling
- Volumetric effects with ray marching
- Film for accumulating samples
- Antialiasing with different filters
- Tonemapping with different operators
- Image based and procedural textures
- BVHs with different widths (2/4/8), optimal and fast SAH builder and vectorized traversal
- Random numbers based on PCG
- Very fast OBJ file loader with material support
- GPU rendering with CUDA (based on megakernel approach, not so fast)
- Offline console rendering and interactive windowed mode

## Instructions

Running the program will open the first test scene in an interactive windowed mode. Use WASD to move and left mouse button to look around. Cycle through the test scenes with number keys.

Edit the valo.ini file to further configure the program. All options can be overridden with command line switches.

### Controls

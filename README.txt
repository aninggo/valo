# Which parts of the assignment did you complete? Mark them 'done'.
# You can also mark non-completed parts as 'attempted' if you spent a fair amount of
# effort on them. If you do, explain the work you did in the problems/bugs section
# and leave your 'attempt' code in place (commented out if necessary) so we can see it.

NOTE: You may have to add "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Include\XXXXXX\ucrt" to VS includes
and "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Lib\XXXXXX\ucrt\x64" to VS lib dirs before compiling.

NOTE: Compile the program with ReleaseFull configuration!
